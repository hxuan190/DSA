Docker Overview

Docker is a platform designed to simplify the development, shipping, and running of applications by using containerization. Containers package software with all its dependencies, ensuring consistency across multiple environments.
Key Concepts

    Container: A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

    Image: A lightweight, immutable file that contains the source code, libraries, and dependencies needed to run the application. Containers are created from Docker images.

    Dockerfile: A text file that contains instructions on how to build a Docker image.

    Docker Hub: A public repository where you can find and share container images.
